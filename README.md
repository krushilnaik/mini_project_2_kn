## Summary
This project aimed to get our hands dirty working with NumPy and Pandas

## Usage

Just navigate to the root directory of this project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by `python ./main.py`


## Notes
1) This assumes you have some variant of Python 3 already installed.

2) If the shebang on top of the Python is messing with you, it's because I wrote this on Windows. If you're on anything else (WSL included), it will probably need to be updated to `#! ./venv/Scripts/python`
